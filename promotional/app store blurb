Practice your math facts as you race against the clock.

CrossSum is word search for math. Thereâ€™s a number at the top of the screen. Somewhere in the grid is the math fact that equals that number. Your job is to find it as fast as possible.

As you advance, CrossSum will get harder, with bigger numbers, different operations, and a larger grid.
